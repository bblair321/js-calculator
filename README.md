Create a JavaScript program that:

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.
Keeps track of all calculations in a history log.
Displays the calculation history upon request.

Create Simple Operations

Implement a set of functions that will add, subtract, multiply and divide 2 numbers and return the result.
Track Operation History

Implement an empty array to store the history of calculations
Each calculation object should contain:
Operands (2 numbers)
Operator (+,-,*,/)
Result of the calculation
Add To and Display the History

Implement the following:
A function to add to the history and be used in all of the simple operation functions
A function to display the history or inform the user that they have no stored calculations

Develop your code and script to match the design. Ensure your script adheres to the following: 

Efficiency: Code is written efficiently and is easily readable.
Functions and Variables: Use appropriate functions and variable names.
Accuracy: Mathematical application and history tracking are accurate.
Coding Best Practices: Adhere to Javascript coding conventions and best practices.
Clarity: Function input and output should be clear and complete.

Run your program with different numbers of occurrences and parameters.
Verify that the appropriate code blocks are executed based on the conditions.
Make any adjustments needed to the code blocks to achieve the desired outcome.

Implement Version Control: Use version control to track changes, allowing for easy updates, collaborative editing, and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Schedule Regular Updates and Reviews: Schedule regular reviews and updates for code to ensure content remains relevant, accurate, and aligned with the latest Python developments and industry practices.
Documentation and Examples Repository: Maintain a centralized repository containing all lab documents, example code, and solutions.
